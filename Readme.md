# AutoSHiFt: Automatically redeem Gearbox SHiFT Codes

- **Compatibility:** 3.12+.
- **Platform:** Crossplatform.
- **Version:** 2.0.0
- **Repo:** https://github.com/Fabbi/autoshift

# Overview ⚠️ Needs Update ⚠️


Data provided by [ugoogalizer's autoshift-scraper](https://github.com/ugoogalizer/autoshift-scraper).

*This tool doesn't save your login data anywhere on your machine!*
After your first login your login-cookie (a string of seemingly random characters) is saved to the `data` folder and reused every time you use `autoshift` after that.

`autoshift` tries to prevent being blocked when it redeems too many keys at once.

You can choose to only redeem mods/skins etc, only golden keys or both. There is also a limit parameter so you don't waste your keys (there is a limit on how many bl2 keys your account can hold for example).

## Installation

you'll need to install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#installation-methods)

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

clone repo or download it as zip:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Fabbi/autoshift.git
```


## Usage

- for help
```sh
uv run autoshift --help
```

- redeem codes for Borderlands 4 on Steam (and keep redeeming every 2 hours)
```sh
uv run autoshift schedule --game bl4 --platform steam
```
